##Description
The second week of school was all about Javascript basics. This project was supposed to create a five or six question quiz that would send a person to information about a vacation they should take. My questions were solely about temperature and danger preferences (ie hot vs. cold, deadly vs dangerous vs safe) and could lead the user to one of six possible vacations. 
##Setup
######Open the index.html file in your browser bar and proceed from there. Currently that is the only way it can be viewed, but when I have it up and running you'll be able to reach it via vrdlc.github.io, my temporary portfolio site.
